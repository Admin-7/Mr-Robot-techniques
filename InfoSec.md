# CTFs and Hacking Games

[**Capture The Flag competitions (CTFs)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security) are sets of puzzles intended to distill the essence of many aspects of professional computer security work into a single short-lived exercise that is objectively measurable. Most competitions are free to participate, and some even award prizes to winners. They are often associated with a conference or event, so are open only at certain times, run for a short while, then close and rank the participants according to the competition's scoring rules.

[**Wargames**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame_(hacking)), sometimes also called **hacking challenges**, are stand-alone puzzlers that are always available (they are not associated with a time or event). Typically, they are organized into levels that get progressively harder as you solve more of them. Some hacking/wargame sites also organize challenges into categories based on the skills you need to solve them.

**Cyberwarfare Ranges** are digital live-fire ranges, semi-private inter-networks where participants can set up and attack other participant's servers and services for educational purposes. They are typically heavily firewalled and accessible only with an invitation and/or through a VPN tunnel; think of them like the digital equivalent of paintball arenas or live-fire gun ranges.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **A note on netiquette.** While each of these gaming styles offer educational opportunities, most have slightly different etiquette. For instance, it's customary for participants to publish solutions to the challenges presented during CTF competitions in the form of writeups on blogs, but this is discouraged by many hacking challenge sites. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the publisher of the challenge you're tackling before you publish your solution to the whole Internet, as you may be spoiling the fun of the game for others.

## CTFs

### CTF calendars and archives

Hundreds of upcoming CTFs are listed at:

* [CTFTime.org](https://ctftime.org/) - List of upcoming CTFs to compete in, central (unofficial) directory of teams, and archive of previous challenge write-ups for educational purposes.
* [CapTF Calendar](http://captf.com/calendar/)

If others are interested, we could probably field [[our own team(s)|CTF team]]. It also might be fun to hang out with the [OpenToAll team](http://opentoallctf.com/) on IRC.

### Recommended CTFs

* [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/)

  An always-open game targeted for high school students but useful for anyone who is just starting out in computer security. Available games are [PicoCTF 2013](https://2013.picoctf.com/), [PicoCTF 2014](https://2014.picoctf.com/), and [PicoCTF 2017](https://2017.picoctf.com/).

* [Ghost in the Shellcode](http://ghostintheshellcode.com/)

  An annual capture-the-flag contest that takes place every winter -- generally in January, but sometimes in February.

## Hacking challenges

* [CTFLearn](https://ctflearn.com/)

  A crowdsourced collection of practice problems ranging from beginner to expert difficulty. Accounts are free, and anyone can post problems, solve problems, or share news about CTFs. Kind of like a [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) or [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) for cybersecurity challenges.

* [Microcorruption](https://www.microcorruption.com)

  The fact that this wargame can be played entirely in your browser makes it really great if you are new to reverse engineering and binary exploitation as you do not have to worry about learning GDB or other tools to get going. It's still really fun even if you are not new. The levels start out simple -- grabbing a key from memory, basic stack smashing -- and get more complicated as defensive measures are enabled and the reversing task is made more complicated by obfuscation.

* [SmashTheStack](http://www.smashthestack.org/)

  üöß TK-TODO (needs a good, succinct description)

* [Cryptopals](http://cryptopals.com)

  Learn how cryptosystems are built and how they are attacked. By the same creators as Microcorruption.

* [Ghost in the Shellcode -- Pwn Adventure](http://pwnadventure.com)

  The CTF has ended but the game server and clients are freely available. There's an MMO-style game that's vulnerable to tampering. I guess the idea is to proxy your connection through some code that will alter your requests and give you superpowers in-game. We could get the server running if a group of people is interested in playing together.

* [Over the Wire](http://overthewire.org)

  This is a series of games played over SSH. Each level corresponds to a user with a shell account on the game server. There's a set of binaries with their setuid flags set. The tasks are typically in the form of: exploit the binary, become the next user, repeat. Unlike micorcorruption, there's no nice webapp debugger, so you'll need to learn GDB, [radare2](http://radare.org) or something. I thought these were really fun, and because the environment is a lot less controlled than microcorruption, I learned a lot about how subtle factors can foil your exploit.

* [io](http://io.netgarage.org), [io64](http://io.netgarage.org:8064), [ioarm](http://188.166.114.127)
  
  Like Over the Wire, the io games are played over SSH with the goal of escalating privileges to advance levels. Home to a great IRC channel too.

* [Exploit Exercises](https://exploit-exercises.com/)

  A variety of virtual machines, documentation and challenges that can be used to learn about a variety of computer security issues such as privilege escalation, vulnerability analysis, exploit development, debugging, reverse engineering, and general cyber security issues. 

* [BreakThiSQLi](http://breakthisqli.rf.gd/)

  SQL injection challenges by increasing difficulty. Fun for the whole database family!

* [CanYouHack.Us](https://canyouhack.us/)

  Mixture of Web and binary security challenges.

* [id0-rsa](https://id0-rsa.pub/)

  Cryptography challenges.

* [pwnable.kr](https://pwnable.kr/)

  More memory corruption. Most levels are vulnerable services running on a particular port. You can exploit them remotely to get a shell, read a "flag" file, and register it with the website to be awarded "points."

* [Reversing.kr](https://reversing.kr/)

  A couple dozen diverse reverse engineering challenges, including Java programs, Windows executables, Linux binaries, and more.

* [RingZer0team.com](https://ringzer0team.com/)

  Several hundred challenges across numerous cybersecurity categories that you can tackle on your own time. Also includes a leaderboard and encourages participants to post write-ups of their solutions to the hacking puzzles, so you can learn from others' successful hacks.

* [HackThisSite](https://www.hackthissite.org/)

  An older (mid-2000's era) set of challenges in Web, IRC, steganograhy, and a few other categories. Notable partly for its hacktivist co-founder, [Jeremy Hammond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond), famed member of [the Anonymous-affiliated group LulzSec](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/05/lulzsec-member-jeremy-hammond-pleads-guilty-to-stratfor-hack/). While outdated, most of the hacking challenges (called "missions") on this site are still decent practice for technology basics that haven't changed much such as fundamental crypto maths, the HTTP protocol, and JavaScript exploitation techniques.

* [W3Challs](https://w3challs.com/)

  Mostly a community site and forum, but has a number of categorized challenges as well, including a couple entirely about writing Web scraping programs.

* [Root Me](https://root-me.org/)

  A collection of a couple hundred stand-alone online challenges and several dozen practice labs ("virtual environments") in a variety of categories.

# Cyberwarfare ranges

* [Arizona Cyberwarfare Range](https://web.archive.org/web/20170211144448/http://azcwr.org/)

# Labs and practice VMs

* [Penteseter Lab](https://PentesterLab.com)
* [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com)
* [Root Me](https://root-me.org/)
* [Hacking Lab](https://www.hacking-lab.com)

# Lesson plans and guidance

* [HackerHigherschool.org](http://hackerhighschool.org/)

  Exceptionally friendly and thorough introduction to penetration testing ("hacking") and general security concepts written with teenagers in mind. Perfect for people who want a more guided path to learning network security and computer exploitation basics. Pair with [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) ([described above](#recommended-ctfs)).

* [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)

  These free guidebooks offer step-by-step instruction manuals for building a GNU/Linux system entirely from source code. Being able to build directly from source, rather than rely on difficult-to-inspect binary packages distributed by vendors, offers extreme advantages to security-conscious users, so it's wise to gain experience doing this. After completing the main guide, additional guides focus on particular interest areas. Of these, the "Hardened Linux From Scratch" guidebook, which "focuses on building an LFS system with heightened security," is of special note as it walks you through the process of configuring many of GNU/Linux's built-in security features.

* [CTF Field Guide](https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/)

  A handy companion guide for learning an interdisciplinary set of skills in infosec, with a mind towards practicing them by puzzling out various CTF challenges.

* [Programming Linux Anti-Reversing Techniques](https://leanpub.com/anti-reverse-engineering-linux)

  A free e-book with a pre-compiled binary that "teaches the reader how to code and analyze well known anti-reversing techniques for Linux. The book shows how a reverse engineer analyzes a binary using tools like IDA, Radare2, GDB, readelf, and more." Useful for learning reverse engineering beginners. Its [companion repositories can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/antire-book).

* [Crypto 101](https://www.crypto101.io/)

  A free and condensed practical introductory course on cryptography, "freely available for programmers of all ages and skill levels." The book's Forward says it "starts with very simple primitives, and gradually introduces new ones, demonstrating why they‚Äôre necessary. Eventually, all of this is put together into complete, practical cryptosystems, such as TLS, GPG and OTR. The goal of this book is not to make anyone a cryptographer or a security researcher. The goal of this book is to understand how complete cryptosystems work from a bird‚Äôs eye view, and how to apply them in real software."

* [A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography](http://toc.cryptobook.us)

  A free textbook developed for use in Stanford's and New York University's computer science and mathematics departments covering cryptography. A beginning reader can read though the book to learn how cryptographic systems work and why they are secure. Some knowledge of basic algebra and probability is assumed but you do not need prior experience with graduate-level mathematics courses to utilize this book. (See also [Coursera.org's Cryptography I course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto), taught by one of this book's co-authors.) Use this text if you are already well-versed with the material covered in "Crypto 101" (above).

# For defenders

* [PrivacyTools.io](https://privacytools.io)

  Simply start at the top and read down the page. This is as guided an introduction to privacy issues and what to do about them as it gets.

* [DIY Feminist Cybersecurity](https://hackblossom.org/cybersecurity/)

  A thorough walk-through showing how to implement basic and intermediate cybersecurity best practices, geared for oppressed groups whose likely adversary are trolls, white supremacists, and other individuals or mob-sized malicious actors. Written with careful explanations and a good grasp of the state of the art. Highly recommended reading for the politically conscious defender.

* [Crash Override Network // Resources](http://www.crashoverridenetwork.com/resources.html)

  A meta-list of additional resources written, compiled, and maintained by the Crash Override Network, including links to purpose-built guides such as [Prevent Doxxing](http://www.crashoverridenetwork.com/preventingdoxing.html) and additional pointers to third-party explainers, such as the [Nonconsensual Intimate Images ("Revenge Porn") Removal Guide](http://www.endrevengeporn.org/online-removal/).
