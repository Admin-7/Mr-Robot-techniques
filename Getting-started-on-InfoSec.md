Even if you're someone who usually just throws themselves into things you find interesting to learn more about it, our [[InfoSec]] page can feel a bit overwhelming. (There's so much…*stuff*…there!) This attempts an even gentler introduction to the same material by compiling recommendations from others who have been there before.

# "Start with Mr. Robot, and pair it with the syllabus."

If TV shows are your thing, and you don't mind using them to study instead of just watching them passively (y'know, pausing the show, looking stuff up, then continuing when your interest in the real world wanes), consider starting out by using our [[Mr. Robot's Netflix 'n' Hack]] syllabus. You could also watch the show a first time and then re-watch it with a more studious intention a second time.

**Do this:**

1. Download/stream/somehow acquire (*cough*pirate*cough*) Mr. Robot episodes from…somewhere.
1. Watch the first episode.
1. Watch the first episode a second time, following along with the syllabus and pausing to read the links. Don't worry about actually installing shit on your box, just start to get a feel of all that is out there and begin reading/browsing/exploring what actually exists and how "real" it all is (or isn't). The syllabus is explicit about what is real and what is not. You will probably be shocked at how you can literally just click on a link from the syllabus and be right in the thick of some "real hacker shit."
1. Download and optionally print out the [Hacker Highschool PDFs](http://www.hackerhighschool.org/lessons.html) (these are also listed in [[InfoSec § Lesson plans and guidance|InfoSec#lesson-plans-and-guidance]], and start reading. (Ignore the bullshit American exceptionalism and capitalist propaganda. In fact, find someone to make make fun of it with. Trust us, it helps.)
1. Do the exercises in the Hacker Highschool course, and incrementally work your way through Mr. Robot Season 1 as you read more of the course. Focus on whichever thing feels more fruitful to you.
1. As you get more curious/comfortable, read the rest of the [[InfoSec]] page and follow links to the various other things there. Especially the [[§ For defenders|InfoSec#for-defenders]] parts.
1. Try out the [Mr. Robot Trains the Trainers](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/tree/master/train-the-trainers/mr-robots-netflix-n-hack/) exercises at whatever pace you want to. Help us make more of them!
