# Digital security

> üìù Editor's note: This is a braindump following up from a recent commsec training; please feel free to organize.

* "[A gentle introduction to threats and how to defend against them](https://maymay.net/blog/2015/07/28/cryptoparty-albuquerque-a-gentle-introduction-to-threats-and-how-to-defend-against-them/)" - This is a video and a heavily-hyperlinked transcript of a presentation I first put together for CryptoParty Albuquerque in 2015, published on my personal blog.
* "[Know Your (Digital) Rights](https://maymay.net/blog/2015/08/08/cryptoparty-albuquerque-know-your-digital-rights/)" - my co-organizer from CryptoParty Albuquerque put together a legal primer, which we also have a video recording and heavily-hyperlinked transcript for posted on my personal blog.
  * Another resource, especially useful for employed people, is the [Privacy Rights Clearinghouse's Consumer Guide on Workplace Privacy and Employee Monitoring](https://www.privacyrights.org/consumer-guides/workplace-privacy-and-employee-monitoring), which gives an overview (and more links) on the legalities of asserting your privacy rights as an employee of a company.

In addition to these primers and the links included in them, additional useful resources are:

* [PrivacyTools.io](https://privacytools.io/) - Simply start at the top and read down the page. This is as guided an introduction to privacy issues and what to do about them as it gets.
* [EFF's Surveillance Self-Defense Handbook](https://ssd.eff.org/) - A thorough treatment of anti-surveillance software, along with tutorials for how to get them installed and working on your system.
  * If you're feeling overwhelmed by all of this already, consider spending just a little bit of time to walk yourself through the [SSD's Security Starter Pack](https://ssd.eff.org/en/playlist/want-security-starter-pack).
* [PRISM-Break!](https://prism-break.org/) - An overwhelmingly large digital reference card for all the privacy-enhancing tools available to you for a particular platform, purpose, or protocol. Be cautious here, some of the listed tools are experimental, not audited, or worse.
* [Security in a Box](https://securityinabox.org/) - A slightly dated, but still generally solid, resource website featuring much of the same content as the EFF's Surveillance Self-Defense guide, but with a regularly updated blog. Created and maintained by the [TacticalTech.org](https://tacticaltech.org/) collective.

There's a ton of stuff in there, and learning about how to defend yourself from governments, corporations, or malicious individuals on the Internet is more involved than simply picking up one or two tools. But a few well-chosen tools does give you a really, really good start. Taking some time to familiarize yourself with the above guides will hopefully help you become even more capable.
