* [[Lockpicking club]], a locksport practice session and meditative discussion circle featuring those most ubiquitous of doorway decorations.

> 🚧 📝 Possible resources for expansion include: physical surveillance (detection, evasion, etc), self-defense tutorials/guides and especially those covering defense against armed attackers (knives, guns, etc), local gyms and training centers.
