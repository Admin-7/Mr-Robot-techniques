Defenders (columns):

* Individuals - people responsible for themselves
* Organizers & journalists - people responsible for other people as well
* Targeted activists - you know who you are

Attackers (rows):

* Random Assholes - malicious individuals, harassers or unsophisticated mobs
* Small organizations (e.g., Assholes with resources) - organized hate groups, more sophisticated / technical Random Assholes, more dedicated assholes ("jilted lovers" with resources), rogue cops
* Governments / Multinational corporations - The Orange One, surveillance apparatus, Wal-Mart, tech companies like Apple+Google+Facebook, etc.

"Z-axis" aspects:

* "Categories" from [PRISM-Break](https://prism-break.org/en/all/), i.e., what to do for server security versus what to do for device/endpoint security versus what to do for data in motion/at rest.

# Individuals vs. Random Assholes

* Scrub personal data from Spokeo/PeopleSearch/Pipl.com, etc.
* Use a password manager (and all that that entails!)
* Don't check in to Foursquare/Yelp/etc publicly
* turn off location services (GPS) on your phone when you don't need it (also saves battery!)
* [Turn off location tagging for your smartphone camera](https://www.wired.com/2013/07/tip-smartphone-camera-gps/)
* Audit/improve your social network privacy settings
* turn off "auto-pay" (and use Password Manager fill-in instead)

# Individuals vs. Small organizations

* Adblockers (uBlock Origin, etc.)
* Clear cookies (cookie-clearing/whitelisting plugins)
* Signal (because of authentication, not just for encryption)
* Audit/revoke your social network account "Connected Apps" settings for apps you don't use
* Possibly put a [credit freeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_freeze) on your credit line at the three major credit

# Individuals vs. Multinationals/Government

* Encrypt your phone/laptop disk at rest (FileVault, Android Encryption, LUKS/cryptsetup)

# Organizers & journalists vs. Random Assholes

* 2FA (on your own accounts and, if you're running a group blog, on your blog site, etc.)
* Use OnionShare/TorBrowser to share files rather than public Dropbox/Google Docs, etc.
* Use a [WHOIS privacy ("Domain privacy")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_privacy) service (or, if you're okay taking the small risk, provide inaccurate WHOIS information)

# Organizers & journalists vs. small organizations

* On your server(s), use LetsEncrypt to enable TLS connections (for Web+Mail+any hosted service)
