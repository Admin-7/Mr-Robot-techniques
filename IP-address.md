In order for one machine to send a message to another, it must have the name of the place at which the intended recipient can be found. This name is called an *address*. At this fundamental level, computer addresses work exactly the same way as postal addresses. If you've ever sent a postcard to a family member or friend while on vacation, you've written an address. Likewise, if you've ever sent an email to a coworker, chatted with a friend on Facebook, or placed a telephone call, you've used an address to direct the message towards your recipient. Postcards use *mailing addresses*, Facebook chats use Facebook *user names*, e-mails use *email addresses*, and telephone calls use *telephone numbers*. These are all examples of addresses.

In many modern digital networks (like the Internet), the "place" in the network at which a given machine can be found is an address called an *[Internet Protocol (IP)](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) address*. Though plentiful, this notion of "place" is not infinite; [it is possible to run out of IP addresses](https://outofips.netlify.app/). In order for any two machines to be able to communicate with one another, both of them need to have their own IP address. When one sends a message to the other, it will write its own IP address on the message's envelope in the *source IP* field and, unsurprisingly, it will write the IP address of its intended recipient on the message's envelope in the *destination IP* field. These message envelopes are called *packet headers*.
