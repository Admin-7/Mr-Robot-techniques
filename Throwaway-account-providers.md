> [[Wiki|Home]] ▸ **Throwaway Account Providers**

A **throwaway account provider** (sometimes also called a "**temporary**" or "**disposable account**") offers users the ability to create temporary addresses that can be used to receive communications from other services for a specific purpose. You can use such services to prevent the collection of your "real" email address or phone number, thereby reducing the amount of spam you might receive and keeping your personal information (but not necessarily your network location or IP address) more hidden than it might be otherwise. Many such services exist, and this section of our wiki attempts to provide a non-exhaustive list of them.

> 💡 Where even more anonymity is desired, consider accessing throwaway account provider services using the [Tor Browser](https://torproject.org/) instead of using your day-to-day regular Web browser.
