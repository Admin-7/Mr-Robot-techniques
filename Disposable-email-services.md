A **disposable email service** (sometimes also called a "**temporary email address**") offers an easy way to use a temporary email inbox for creating pseudonymous user accounts on other services that would otherwise collect your primary email address. You can use such services to prevent the collection of your "real" email address, thereby reducing the amount of spam you might receive and keeping your personal address more hidden than it might be otherwise. Thousands of free-to-use, disposable email services exist.
