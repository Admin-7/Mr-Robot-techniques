      <li>Start at the top-left cell and read the advice from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, until you reach your cell. Then stop worrying. :)</li>

# Individuals versus Random Assholes

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites. The material presented on this page is *relevant to every persona and every risk level*. These practices therefore represent *a minimum level of best-practice* and are foundational to every other risk assessment presented in this framework.

## Practices

* Scrub personal data and [opt-out](https://www.privacyrights.org/data-brokers) from "[Data broker/vendor](https://privacyrights.org/data-brokers)" sites such as Spokeo/PeopleSearch/Pipl.com, etc.
* Don't check in to places on Facebook/Foursquare/Yelp/etc publicly
* turn off location services (GPS) on your phone when you don't need it (also saves battery!)
* [Turn off location tagging for your smartphone camera](https://www.wired.com/2013/07/tip-smartphone-camera-gps/)
* Audit/improve your social network privacy settings
  * Verify friend requests with actual friends: When you get a Friend request from someone you don't know, but have mutual friends in common, send your mutual friend a private message asking for info about who the supposed person who may have sent the friend request actually is; avoids friending malicious/fake accounts.
* turn off "auto-pay" (and use Password Manager fill-in instead)
* Remove "saved fingers" (fingerprint scans) from your smartphone's memory, i.e., use a PIN or passphrase, or if you do choose to use a fingerprint, use only one or two finger's prints. (The more fingers you add, the easier it is for someone who is not you to use *their* fingerprint to open your device.)
  * [About Touch ID on iPhone and iPad (Apple iOS)](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201371)
* Use a password manager (and all that that entails!)
  * Use strong passwords. Most password managers will help you generate these, and the main thing is that they should be long. If it's a password you will sometimes have to type in (i.e. your password manager cannot fill it in for you on a particular machine), use a long passphrase with words, words will be easier for you to type than a bunch of random characters.
  * Generate random passphrases for your "password reset questions". Don't answer such questions honestly, because [basic facts like where you went to school or your spouse's name can generally be found on social networks and data brokers](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/tree/master/train-the-trainers/mr-robots-netflix-n-hack/week-2/strengthening-passwords-to-defend-against-john#preparing-a-personally-targeted-attack).
* In addition to a password manager, use an identity manager such as [SQRL](https://grc.com/sqrl), when available.
