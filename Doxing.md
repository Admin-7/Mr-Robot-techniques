> ðŸš§ TK-TODO: This is intended to be a practical guide to doxing, both the offensive (how to dox) and defensive (how to prevent getting doxed). Right now, it's just a link-dump, so don't rely on this page for anything serious. We also don't plan to reiterate existing information. This is a *conceptual* overview/framework, akin to our [[Persona based training matrix]].
