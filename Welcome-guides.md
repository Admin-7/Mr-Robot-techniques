> [[Wiki|Home]] â–¸ **Welcome guides**

These guides offer an introduction to our collective practices and some guidance for what we expect of friends and comrades. By making these desires explicit, we hope it will be easier to forge and sustain mutually beneficial relationships that increase our capacity to organize against the end of the world, while nurturing the loving possibilities of a better one.
