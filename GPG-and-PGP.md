GPG is a [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) implementation of the proprietary PGP [cryptosystem](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptosystem) originally designed by Phil Zimmerman and released in 1991. As a general-purpose cryptosystem, it can be used to encrypt any arbitrary data, as well as verify digital signatures, although it is most famous for its implementation as an e-mail body privacy measure. The Anarcho-Tech NYC collective makes use of the GPG software suite in a number of contexts, some of which are discussed on this page and pages linked from here.
