# Welcome to the AnarchoTechNYC wiki!

The AnarchoTechNYC wiki is a collection of thoughts, guides, and links, with a focus on building anti-fascist tools, supporting our communities against authoritarian regimes. Here are a few good starting points for folks who want to explore what the AnarchoTechNYC wiki has to offer, and contribute back to our community.

# [[Training guides]]

* [[Self-defense training]] - guide to preparing yourself to fight, physically if necessary.
* [[Anti-fascist training]] - guide to understanding the political landscape.
* [[Security culture training]] - guide to computer, information, and cybersecurity practices.

# [[Activities and events]]

One of the best parts of AnarchoTechNYC are the regular activities and traditions that tech antifa folks have created over the years. Some are ongoing [[activities and events]] while others are one-offs, but any can be revived and new ones created by *you* at any time!

* [[Mr. Robot's Netflix 'n' Hack]] - Let Mr. Robot teach you how to hack.

# [[Accomplices and allies]]

In addition to the AnarchoTechNYC group, there are a lot of affinity groups with whom we collaborate. Check some of them out!
