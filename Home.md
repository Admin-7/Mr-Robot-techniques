The AnarchoTechNYC wiki is **an evolving workspace of shared knowledge with a focus on building anti-fascist tools, and supporting our communities** against settler-colonial, imperialist, and authoritarian regimes. Here are a few good starting points for folks who want to explore what the AnarchoTechNYC wiki has to offer, and contribute back to our community.

* [Welcome guides](#welcome-guides) - Newcomers may want to start here.
* [Activities and events](#activities-and-events) - ongoing or semi-regular events we help make happen.
* [Accomplices and allies](#accomplices-and-allies) - friends and comrades intimately involved in our work. Check 'em out! :)

# [[Welcome guides]]

If you're looking to get involved, consider exploring this wiki! There's plenty here for you to expand, critique, and share. Since there's a lot here, this list suggests a few pages to start from:

* [[New member orientation guide]] - A self-paced walk-through to familiarize yourself with how we stay in touch.
* [[Security culture]] - Before you can fuck shit up, you need to get this shit down.

# [[Activities and events]]

One of the best parts of AnarchoTechNYC are the regular activities and traditions that tech antifa folks have created over the years. Some are ongoing activities while others are one-offs, but any can be revived and new ones created by *you* at any time! Some of our more consistent activities are listed below, but be sure to check out the [[Activities and events]] portal page for a full list.

* [[Capture The Flag (CTF) gaming|CTF team]] - An irregular cybersecurity study group participating in online wargaming competitions.
* [[Cyborg clinic]] - holistic (mental/physical/cybernetic) health sessions for anyone who wants to reclaim their time and energy from the apps demanding too much of it.
* [[Lockpicking club]] - A locksport practice session and meditative discussion circle.
* [[Mr. Robot's Netflix 'n' Hack]] - Educational film and TV screenings with a supplementary syllabus; let "Mr. Robot" teach you how to hackâ€”and how to stop a hacker from hacking you!

Our events are **always free** to attend, but we do need your help to sustain our activities. If you have the means, please consider [donating via PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/AnarchoTechNYC), [BitCoin](bitcoin:17ByVbkM6mf7bytqWRFwzjqradBkmVh4Tr?label=AnarchoTechNYC), or with cash in person. (There will almost certainly be a large glass tip jar.) For more details, please read [Donations and support](#donations-and-support).

# [[Accomplices and allies]]

There are many [[other groups|Accomplices and allies]] with whom we collaborate, share resources, and otherwise ally with. Check them out, get involved with them, or otherwise support the ones that resonate strongly with you. Of course, if you're in NYC, come to Anarcho-Tech Collective meetings, or any event, and say hi to some of us in person.

You can find meeting and event details at [Anarchism.NYC](http://Anarchism.NYC/).

Donations cannot be earmarked; they go to equipment purchases and repairs, snacks and refreshments, venue rental fees, and direct financial support to active collective members in need, as we deem necessary.

But **please remember** that while cash is nice, what we really need it for are these other materials (food, drink, and other necessities). We would far prefer to simply acquire those other necessities of life directly, without the need for something so capitalist as money. So, **other ways to support our events include** showing up early to help set up, helping clean up afterwards, bringing food and refreshments yourself, and **doing anything that the money would go for yourself, directly.**

TL:DR; We do not sell anything, but we still need to survive in capitalism. If you like what we're doing here and want it to continue, please use some of your money to free our time so that we can do more of this and less of wage slavery. Thanks!
