The AnarchoTechNYC wiki is **an evolving workspace of shared knowledge with a focus on building anti-fascist tools, and supporting our communities** against settler-colonial, imperialist, and authoritarian regimes. Here are a few good starting points for folks who want to explore what the AnarchoTechNYC wiki has to offer, and contribute back to our community.

* [Welcome guides](#welcome-guides) - Newcomers may want to start here.
* [Activities and events](#activities-and-events) - ongoing or semi-regular events we help make happen.
* [Accomplices and allies](#accomplices-and-allies) - friends and comrades intimately involved in our work. Check 'em out! :)

# [[Welcome guides]]

If you're looking to get involved, consider exploring this wiki! There's plenty here for you to expand, critique, and share. Since there's a lot here, this list suggests a few pages to start from:

* [[New member orientation guide]] - A self-paced walk-through to familiarize yourself with how we stay in touch.
* [[Security culture]] - Before you can fuck shit up, you need to get this shit down.

# [[Activities and events]]

One of the best parts of AnarchoTechNYC are the regular activities and traditions that tech antifa folks have created over the years. Some are ongoing activities while others are one-offs, but any can be revived and new ones created by *you* at any time! Some of our more consistent activities are listed below, but be sure to check out the [[Activities and events]] portal page for a full list.

* [[Capture The Flag (CTF) gaming|CTF team]] - An irregular cybersecurity study group participating in online wargaming competitions.
* [[Cyborg clinic]] - holistic (mental/physical/cybernetic) health sessions for anyone who wants to reclaim their time and energy from the apps demanding too much of it
* [[Mr. Robot's Netflix 'n' Hack]] - Educational film and TV screenings with a supplementary syllabus; let "Mr. Robot" teach you how to hackâ€”and how to stop a hacker from hacking you!

# [[Accomplices and allies]]

In addition to the AnarchoTechNYC group, there are many [[other groups|Accomplices and allies]] with whom we collaborate, share resources, and otherwise ally with. Check them out, get involved with them, or otherwise support the ones that resonate strongly with you.

Of course, if you're in NYC, come to Anarcho-Tech Collective meetings, or any event, and say hi to some of us in person. You can find meeting and event details at [Anarchism.NYC](http://Anarchism.NYC/).
