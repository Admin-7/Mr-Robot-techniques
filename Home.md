The NYC chapter of **the Anarcho-Tech Collective provides technological and digital infrastructure support services to anti-fascist, anti-racist, and anti-capitalist organizations** in New York City. We are an entirely volunteer-run organization and operate without any licensing or legal documentation. We intentionally operate with a financial budget of as close to zero as possible, so we generally appreciate [support](#donations-and-support) in the form of volunteer time and physical resources.

This wiki is an evolving workspace of shared knowledge with a focus on building anti-fascist tools, and supporting our communities against settler-colonial, imperialist, and authoritarian regimes. See [¬ß What's on this wiki](#whats-on-this-wiki) for a few good starting points if you want to explore what the AnarchoTech NYC wiki has to offer, and contribute back to our community. Additionally, there are many [[other groups|Accomplices and allies]] ranging across numerous political ideologies with whom we collaborate, share resources, and otherwise ally with. We encourage you to get involved with them, or otherwise support the ones that resonate strongly with you.

If you're presently in NYC, feel free to come to our chapter's Anarcho-Tech Collective public meetings, or any affiliated event, and say hi to some of us in person. You can find details for many public meetings and events at [Anarchism.NYC](http://Anarchism.NYC/) and [TakeActionNYC.com](http://takeactionnyc.com/).

If you're looking to get involved, consider exploring this wiki! There's plenty here for you to expand, and share. This list suggests a few pages from which to start:

1. [[Social rules]] - Please read this short page first, which is designed to help you become a valuable and valued participant in our spaces.
1. [[New member orientation guide]] - Self-paced walk-through to familiarize yourself with how we get shit done.
1. [[Security culture]] - Before you can fuck shit up, you need to get this shit down.
1. [Projects](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/projects) - High-level overview of our collective's current projects; these represent the main areas where you can directly contribute to our work.

# [[Foundations]]

If you're just getting started with "tech stuff" for the first time, or if you've had an unconventional exposure or education on the topic, there's a good chance a lot of the terms, concepts, and fundamental principles you need to know have been poorly explained (at best). At least, that was our experience. To address this, we've compiled quick guides to foundational principles along with heavily curated suggestions for various learning paths in our [[Foundations]] pages; these are the guides we wish we had when we were getting started.

# Donations and support

You can make a single donation via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/AnarchoTechNYC/25) or [BitCoin](https://blockchain.info/qr?data=bitcoin:17ByVbkM6mf7bytqWRFwzjqradBkmVh4Tr?label=AnarchoTechNYC&size=200) of whatever amount you are comfortable with. To do so, tap, click, or scan any of the donation links or barcodes on our various websites. These donations will *not* be processed repeatedly.

For BitCoin, you can:

* Copy and paste our BitCoin address: `17ByVbkM6mf7bytqWRFwzjqradBkmVh4Tr`

* Tap or click on a Bitcoin donate banner. They look like this:

Donations cannot be earmarked; they go to equipment purchases and repairs, snacks and refreshments, venue rental fees, and direct financial support to active collective members in need, as we deem necessary.

But **please remember** that while cash is nice, what we really need it for are these other materials (food, drink, and other necessities). We would far prefer to simply acquire those other necessities of life directly, without the need for something so Statist as money. So, **other ways to support our events include** showing up early to help set up, helping clean up afterwards, bringing food and refreshments yourself, and **doing anything that the money would go for yourself, directly.**

TL:DR; We do not sell anything, but we still need to survive in capitalism. If you like what we're doing here and want it to continue, please use some of your money to free our time so that we can do more of this and less of wage slavery. Thanks!
