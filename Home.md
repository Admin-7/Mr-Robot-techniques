# Welcome to the AnarchoTechNYC wiki!

The AnarchoTechNYC wiki is **an evolving workspace of shared knowledge with a focus on building anti-fascist tools, and supporting our communities** against settler-colonial, imperialist, and authoritarian regimes. Here are a few good starting points for folks who want to explore what the AnarchoTechNYC wiki has to offer, and contribute back to our community.

* [Welcome guides](#welcome-guides) - Newcomers may want to start here.
* [Activities and events](#activities-and-events) - ongoing or semi-regular events we help make happen.
* [Accomplices and allies](#accomplices-and-allies) - friends and comrades intimately involved in our work. Check 'em out! :)

# [[Welcome guides]]

If you're looking to get involved with our collective, please consider exploring this wiki! There's plenty here for you to expand, critique, and share. Since there's a lot here, this list suggests a few pages to start from:

* [[New member orientation guide]] - a self-paced walkthrough to familiarize yourself with how we organize.

# [[Activities and events]]

One of the best parts of AnarchoTechNYC are the regular activities and traditions that tech antifa folks have created over the years. Some are ongoing activities while others are one-offs, but any can be revived and new ones created by *you* at any time! Some of our more consistent and exciting activities are listed below, but be sure to check out the [[Activities and events]] portal page for a full list.

* [[Mr. Robot's Netflix 'n' Hack]] - Let Mr. Robot teach you how to hack.

# [[Accomplices and allies]]

In addition to the AnarchoTechNYC group, there are many [[other groups|Accomplices and allies]] with whom we collaborate, share resources, and otherwise ally with. Check them out, get involved with them, or otherwise support the ones that resonate strongly with you.

Of course, if you're in NYC, come to Anarcho-Tech Collective meetings and say hi to some of us in person; find our meeting details on [The Base's calendar](https://thebasebk.org/calendar/).
