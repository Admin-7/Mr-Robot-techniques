# Welcome to the AnarchoTechNYC wiki!

The AnarchoTechNYC wiki is **a collection of thoughts, guides, and links, with a focus on building anti-fascist tools, and supporting our communities** against authoritarian regimes. Here are a few good starting points for folks who want to explore what the AnarchoTechNYC wiki has to offer, and contribute back to our community.

# [[Training guides]]

> üìù Editor's note: Do we really have responsibility for all these guides, or just the "security culture" stuff and, within that, just the "digital security" piece? We may need to scope this down further and/or prune the pieces we are not actually bottom lining.

Self-directed education is a critical first step to empowering yourself, your loved ones, and your community. Our [[training guides]] are living documents offering you a place to *start* learning and exploring, rather than a one-stop shop or one size fits all knowledge dump. Our guides are organized into three broad categories:

* [[Self-defense training]] - guide to preparing yourself to fight, physically if necessary.
* [[Anti-fascist training]] - guide to understanding the political landscape.
* [[Security culture training]] - guide to computer, information, and cybersecurity practices.

# [[Activities and events]]

One of the best parts of AnarchoTechNYC are the regular activities and traditions that tech antifa folks have created over the years. Some are ongoing activities while others are one-offs, but any can be revived and new ones created by *you* at any time! Some of our more consistent and exciting activities are listed below, but be sure to check out the [[Activities and events]] portal page for a full list.

* [[Mr. Robot's Netflix 'n' Hack]] - Let Mr. Robot teach you how to hack.

# [[Accomplices and allies]]

In addition to the AnarchoTechNYC group, there are many [[other groups|Accomplices and allies]] with whom we collaborate, share resources, and otherwise ally with. Check them out, get involved with them, or otherwise support the ones you that resonate strongly with you.

Of course, if you're in NYC, come to Anarcho-Tech Collective meeting and say hi to some of us in person; find our meeting details on [The Base's calendar](https://thebasebk.org/calendar/).
