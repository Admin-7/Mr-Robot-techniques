> üìù **WORK IN PROGRESS**: This is a drafting pad, simply notes at the moment. I'm learning a lot about this specific technology and don't know enough to teach, so I'm currently just compiling my own research (in public). Please don't consider this recommendations of "good" educational material, especially if you're coming from the much-more polished [[InfoSec]] page(s).

# "Learn from‚Ä¶"

* [Hak5 playlist: Software Defined Radio](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBmFDs_1nZfBN2x5dbFXO7RfcwVGrqQy-)

  The male co-host of this show, Darren Kitchen, behaves like a classic techbro prick and his explanations aren't great but there is some decent beginner-level information here in a playlist that is sorted sensibly (from basic to advanced). The real value is in paying attention to the female co-host's (Shannon Morse's) learning process, which seems like it begins to carve a learning path for newbies like me.

  The ARRL is a licensing body that administers examinations and awards credentials for legal compliance in operating radio transmitters (it is generally safe and legal to passively receive radio signals, i.e., to listen to electro-magnetic spectrum radiation, but it is not legal to transmit, i.e., to speak using the same mechanism, i.e., EM/radio). This video series is a "teach-to-the-test" free course by a long-time licensed ham radio operator that for the most basic of these licenses, the "Tech" exam. The next exam is the "[General](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0R9jy9LZw_35KimLiSIOH0YdNtCeYcRe)" license and finally the "[Amateur Extra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0R9jy9LZw_3CHCH-5A8faeIA-H3e4ZNC)" license.
