We have a semi-private [[Capture The Flag|InfoSec#ctfs-and-hacking-games]] team by the same name open to collective members who are interested in practicing cybersecurity skills. The [team is registered on CTFTime.org](https://ctftime.org/team/34635) and coordinates wargames in [a private room on Gitter (this link will report "Not found" if you are not already invited to join)](https://gitter.im/AnarchoTechNYC/CTF). We are focused on skill sharing, education, and autonomy, not necessarily winning competitions.

# How to join

To join the team, you must request an invitation from [an existing @AnarchoTechNYC/ctf team member or organizer](https://github.com/orgs/AnarchoTechNYC/teams/ctf), preferably via [[our main Signal thread|New member orientation guide#signal]]. If you are not already chatting with us on our main Signal thread, you can contact team members privately. Current CTF team members who are organizing games include:
