Anarcho-Tech NYC hosts a semi-private, eponymous [[Capture The Flag|InfoSec#ctfs-and-hacking-games]] team open to collective members who are interested in practicing cybersecurity skills. We have also [partnered](#volunteer-ctf-mentoring) with [Tech Learning Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com/) to offer unofficial cybersecurity training (on a volunteer/ad-hoc basis) during some CTFs. [Our own semi-private team is registered on CTFTime.org](https://ctftime.org/team/34635) and coordinates wargames in [a private room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/AnarchoTechNYC/CTF) (this link will report "Not found" if you are not already invited to join or not logged in to your Gitter account). We are focused on skill sharing, education, and autonomy, not necessarily winning competitions.

> üî∞ **This is a strictly beginner-friendly team.** While there are members of various skill levels, this team is expressly designed to be a valuable team to join if you have never before participated in CTF competitions. Team organizers are strict about maintaining an expressly educational environment, while de-emphasizing competition and score-keeping, and actively promoting cooperation and knowledge sharing.
> 
> More **advanced members are expected to act as mentors, trainers, tutors, and compassionate educators.** Advanced/experienced team members who are uninterested in being patient educators are encouraged to create their own CTF teams elsewhere. Advanced players who undermine educational opportunities of less-experienced team members, or who prioritize competition above education, will be forcibly removed from the team in order to maintain a beginner-friendly atmosphere.

# Volunteer CTF mentoring

We have partnered with [Tech Learning Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com/), one of the best and most politically-engaged cybersecurity educational groups that exist today, to offer unofficial cybersecurity training (on a volunteer/ad-hoc basis) during some CTFs that our members compete in. There is no fee to join. Simply enter [our general chat Lobby](https://gitter.im/AnarchoTechNYC/Lobby) during a CTF and say hello.
