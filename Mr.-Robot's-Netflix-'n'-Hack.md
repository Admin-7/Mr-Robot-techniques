* Tagline: Let Mr. Robot teach you how to hack‚Äîand how to stop hackers from hacking you!
* Description: Watch an episode of "[Mr. Robot](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/62560-mr-robot)," a TV show dramatizing the lives of rogue hackers in NYC with unparalleled technical accuracy, and then get an introduction to how the tools, techniques, and procedures ("[TTPs](https://forensicswiki.xyz/wiki/index.php?title=Cyber_Threat_Intelligence#TTP)") shown in the episode work in real life. After we watch an episode of the show, we'll discuss the tools used, get them installed on our laptops, and try them out. When we meet next, we'll show one another what we've learned, and continue with the next episode. By the end of the 10 week first season, you'll have gotten a hands-on tour of various tools in the [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) penetration testing distro, and a better sense of how to separate fiction from reality in contemporary hacking dramas in pop culture. We'll finish by tackling [a Mr. Robot themed hacking challenge](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/) so you can practice what you've learned, and maybe even join a [[hacking team|CTF team]].

  * [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) (not actually the tool shown, maybe Eliot has a script that wraps this?) - offline tool
    * ["dictionary brute force"](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=dictionary_attack)

* "Redirect the traffic‚Ä¶" Gideon says.
  * Using [`ifconfig`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/ifconfig), a command line tool to *config*ure a network *i*nter*f*ace.
  * "Routers" are just computers, but with dedicated operating systems with different network interface configuration commands, such as [CISCO iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS) (proprietary) or [VyOS](https://vyos.io/), a free software clone of Cisco's iOS, useful if you can't pay for an iOS license.
  * "Redirecting," in the context of the episode's scene, may mean:
    * re-route incoming packets that are part of the DDoS to [a network black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_%28networking%29), if the packets can be identified as part of the attack.
    * And if not, then he may mean "redirect" incoming visitors to a [high-availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability) version of the hosted services, such as a read-only or otherwise low-resource use instance.
    * The specific intent depends on AllSafe's and ECorp's specific setup, and it's not clear what's actually happening, except that this is the kind of chatter you might hear from [SOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_operations_center) or [NOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_operations_center) workers.

  * "Getting root" means to "acquire access to the `root` user on a UNIX-like operating system," since that user is by definition granted all [privileges/rights to a system](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379306(v=vs.85).aspx). (In a Windows context, this is called "getting System" and [Meterpreter has a command by that name, `getsystem`](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/privilege-escalation/), because [the most privileged user account on a Windows computer is the `LocalSystem` account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684190(v=vs.85).aspx).)
    * It's less common to get root (or System) privileges directly; often you must first find some other vulnerability to exploit, then "escalate your privileges." This is called *privilege escalation* ("privesc" for short):

  * "Box" is just a slang term for "computer."
  * "The IP" refers to the [Internet Protocol address](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address), literally the equivalent of a computer's "home/mailing address" that anyone who wants to send messages to the computer usually needs to know. Here, Cisco refers not to his box's IP address, but the IP address of the Dark Army's servers.
  * "Their channel" is a reference to the IRC chat room that the Dark Army uses to communicate, seen in an earlier episode. In IRC, chat rooms are called "channels," and hacker slang usually uses the two terms ("chat room" or "channel") somewhat interchangeably.
  * "My [handle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_%28computing%29)" means "the username (or screen name) I use." Here, Cisco just means that after Darlene hacked his computer, she impersonated him, using his persona to communicate with the Dark Army directly.

* "Log data from the Dark Army's backdoored machine. They're using this guy's account, Frank Bowman. He's a member of the [code signing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing) architecture team. This is what they're doing: they want to sign their own firmware and bypass my patch. If they do that, they'll blow up the downtown recovery buidling. My only chance to stop it is to get to the [hardware security modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module), the HSMs. They're on the 23rd floor."
