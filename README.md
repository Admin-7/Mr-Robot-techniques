# Meta Wiki

> üìù This page exists to provide parity with a local clone of the `meta` repository. Treat this file like a `README.md` file as [described in the repository's own README itself](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/blob/master/README.md#repository-structure), rather than as a wiki page.

We make extensive use of our [`meta` repository](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta)'s [associated wiki](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki) to provide:

* a low-fidelity "website" for newcomers to browse,
* an easier-to-edit collaborative drafting space for the collective's works-in-progress, and
* storage for collective memory in the form of textual documents that may change quickly.

Files in this directory are shown as pages on our GitHub-hosted wiki and rendered by [Gollum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum_Wiki).
