Sometimes, the best way to learn a thing (about infosec/cybersecurity) is to just find someone willing to show-and-tell you stuff about it. It's also useful to have a mix of active (practice) and passive (consumptive) educational material.

> üìù üöß This is somewhat of an experiment to see if a list like this is useful. It's intended to be a sort of passive-study supplement to the material in the "parent" [[InfoSec]] page on this wiki. My thinking is that it's nice to be given a guided path through "the black hole of YouTube" for long bus rides, meal times, or other periods where our hands cannot be on the keyboard.

* [The Secret Life of SIM Cards - Defcon 21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31D94QOo2gY)

  An August, 2013 presentation detailing everything you wanted to know about SIM cards, which are basically an additional mini-computer inside your mobile phone (including "dumb" phones, not just smartphones), but didn't know to ask. This talk introduces you to what a SIM card is, why it exists, and what your telephone company uses them for.

* [How Tor Users Got Caught - Defcon 22 (Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G1LjQSYM5Q), and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ2bk9kMneI)

  Four examples of people who have used Tor for illegal activities and how they were caught. Multiple Tor de-anonymization attacks are shown at the end of the video. [Source](http://se.azinstall.net/2015/11/how-tor-users-got-caught.html).

* [The Science of Insecurity - ShmooCon 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiqioE1zGCw)

  Why is the overwhelming majority of networked software still not secure, despite all effort to the contrary? In this talk we'll draw a direct connection between this ubiquitous insecurity and basic computer science concepts of Turing completeness and theory of languages. We will show how well-meant protocol designs are doomed to their implementations becoming clusters of 0day, and will show where to look for these 0day. We will also discuss simple principles of how to avoid designing such protocols.

* [SecureDrop: Leaking safely to modern news organizations](https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/securedrop-leaking-safely-to-modern-news-organizations/) (LibrePlanet 2017)

  Learn how [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/) maintains a free software anonymous whistleblowing platform used by major news organizations, called [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org/). Senior DevOps Engineer for the SecureDrop project, Conor Schaefer, outlines the project's history, provides an overview of its current architecture, and discusses the challenges of managing a largely decentralized platform with high security requirements.

* [Something Something Security, by Troy Hunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVXEwfH6FLc)

  A humorous look into the abysmal state of online security.
