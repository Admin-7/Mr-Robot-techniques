> You are here: [[Wiki|Home]] â–¸ :mask: **Social distancing**

During the [(COVID-19) coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), many people are asking us for our recommendations of digital tools to support their community's emotional and mental health. Isolation, loneliness, and lack of intimate contact can dramatically reduce the quality of life for already vulnerable populations. With stress levels high, and public officials warning of extended periods of [social distancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing) measures necessary for many months to come, we've decided to compile a list of *unvetted* digital platforms that you might be able to use to augment your social interactions to stay as healthy and happy as possible throughout the crisis.

> :warning: :shield: *None* of these sources have been vetted for security or privacy. Quite the opposite, these are simply apps, websites, and other tools you can use to "virtually" hang out with others from a distance, similar to traditional voice and video conferencing services. Please do *not* consider inclusion on this list to imply that we believe these are Anarchist-friendly, politically-aligned, or otherwise safe places.
>
> :construction: :memo: This is a fast-evolving list and many categories of software overlap with one another. **Please contribute** as you are able by [posting a new issue on our issue tracker](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/issues/new).
