There is a near-constant buzz of organizing activity in New York City. In addition to the day-to-day hum of socializing, planning, and learning that happens among AnarchoTechNYC members, we also often organize recurring or one-off events. These include workshops, documentary screenings, and a bunch of other things you may not think of immediately! Some of these activities become traditions and are continued by multiple organizers.

# Activities

Activities are things to do with your fellow antifa comrades that are happening on a(t least a semi-)regular basis at AnarchoTechNYC meetings/spaces. More details are available on a given event's wiki page.

* [[Capture The Flag (CTF) gaming|CTF team]] - An irregular cybersecurity study group participating in online wargaming competitions.
* [[Mr. Robot's Netflix 'n' Hack]] - Let Mr. Robot teach you how to hack.

# Events

Events are one-offs because they are either intended to be or just aren't happening regularly anymore. (You could always start doing these on a regular basis, if you want!)

* [[Digital fight training]] - Cybersecurity sparring sessions where we set up network perimeters and devices, and practice both breaching and hardening them.
* [[Ethics refactoring]] - analyze a feature/product for its "operative ethic" and then redesign the same feature/product for a different ethic
* [[Android forensics study group]] - learn how to detect whether an Android device has been cloned or tampered with
