# Activities

Activities are things to do with your fellow antifa comrades that are happening on a(t least a semi-)regular basis at AnarchoTechNYC meetings/spaces. More details are available on a given event's wiki page.

* [[Mr. Robot's Netflix 'n' Hack]] - Let Mr. Robot teach you how to hack.

# Events

Events are one-offs because they are either intended to be or just aren't happening regularly anymore. (You could always start doing these on a regular basis, if you want!)

* [[Ethics refactoring]] - analyze a feature/product for its "operative ethic" and then redesign the same feature/product for a different ethic
