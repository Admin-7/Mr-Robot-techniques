# Suggested learning path

If you don't know where to start *and* don't really know where to go in your studies next, consider starting here:

1. [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](http://www.charlespetzold.com/code/)

    Read this before you read anything else. Everything in the world of computer code is ultimately a way of expressing the full range of complex ideas a human being can imagine using nothing more complex than two words: "yes" and "no." And what is a computer "word?" This book explains it, and does it very well.

## General programming

1. [Exercises in Programming Style](http://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programming-Style-Cristina-Videira/dp/1482227371/)

    A [companion code repository](https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style) is on GitHub.

## Web development

1. [Foundation Website Creation](https://www.worldcat.org/title/foundation-website-creation-with-css-xhtml-and-javascript/oclc/646766089)
1. [AdvancED CSS](https://www.worldcat.org/title/advanced-css/oclc/500470223)
1. [The New CSS Layout](https://abookapart.com/products/the-new-css-layout)

## Information security

Information security ("[[InfoSec]]") is the practice of protecting (possibly very sensitive) information from unauthorized or unintentional access, modification, or outright destruction. Our collective's work is atypical in that we make every attempt to discuss security-related concepts and considerations inline at every opportunity, which supports our [Train the Trainers](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/blob/master/train-the-trainers/README.md) project. Nevertheless, we also offer a learning path and study guide for those interested in developing their InfoSec skills, specifically.

See [[Getting started on InfoSec]] for InfoSec learning path recommendations.
