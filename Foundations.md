# Suggested learning path

If you don't know where to start *and* don't really know where to go in your studies next, consider starting here:

1. [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](http://www.charlespetzold.com/code/)

    Read this before you read anything else. Everything in the world of computer code is ultimately a way of expressing the full range of complex ideas a human being can imagine using nothing more complex than two words: "yes" and "no." And what is a computer "word?" This book explains it, and does it very well.

## General programming

1. [Exercises in Programming Style](http://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programming-Style-Cristina-Videira/dp/1482227371/)

    A [companion code repository](https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style) is on GitHub.

## Web development

1. [Foundation Website Creation](https://www.worldcat.org/title/foundation-website-creation-with-css-xhtml-and-javascript/oclc/646766089)
1. [AdvancED CSS](https://www.worldcat.org/title/advanced-css/oclc/500470223)
1. [The New CSS Layout](https://abookapart.com/products/the-new-css-layout)
