# Requirements

The following equipment is needed for a successful Trivia night:

* [ ] The [FBCTF](https://github.com/facebook/fbctf) platform exposed to the event venue's LAN; the FBCTF "Quiz Levels" ([see the Admin Guide](https://github.com/facebook/fbctf/wiki/Admin-Guide)) are the night's Trivia Questions.
* [ ] A projector or large screen (large enough for easy viewing by a group of 20 or so).
* [ ] Adapter cabling for the A/V setup, if necessary.
* [ ] Access to decent Wi-Fi; the digital scorecards are accessed over the venue's WLAN to the trivia server (FBCTF server).
* [ ] A list of prepared trivia questions, complete with:
    * [ ] Point values per question
    * [ ] Optionally, a single hint for each question
    * [ ] Optionally, a hint penalty in points for each question's hint
