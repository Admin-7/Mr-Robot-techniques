* Tagline: Get or give tech help, tips, and support to learn, play, and get shit done in an open and welcoming environment.
* Description: Sometimes, we need help. Other times, we want a new challenge. Come to our tech open forum to get or give tech help on your own projects or on someone else's! These events offer a space for a self-directed and social mixer to meet and learn from others, build knowledge and skills in our community, enjoy the anti-consumerist and anti-capitalist vibes that come with DIY workshops, play and teach one another new tricks, or to fix whatever's blocking you from getting shit done on your computer. Come with questions, or come willing to find the answers by exploring with others. At our open forum, please keep in mind some lightweight social rules ([["be supportive," "be proportional," and "be engaged"|Social rules]]) to help make the space welcoming to people of all skill and experience levels.
