The AnarchoTechNYC collective is but one of a number of affinity groups organizing against fascism. This page lists other groups with whom we have some collaboration. None of these links are endorsements; ask a comrade about the specific work being done if you're interested in learning more about our work.

> üìù Editor's note: Please keep this list alphabetized for ease of reference, and focus on groups who have shown an interest in actual collaboration, not just a link-dump of groups we know exist. (Thank you!)
