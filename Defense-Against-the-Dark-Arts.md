* Tagline: Digital fight training where we set up network perimeters and devices, and practice both breaching and hardening them.
* Description: Practice defending against and executing a specific real-world threat in a live (but simulated) duel against your classmates. In each session, we'll go deep with a narrow focus on a specific threat (network monitoring, physical surveillance, web app compromise, etc). After an overview, we'll split into two groups: "attackers" and "defenders." Defenders will be tasked with defending one or more services, devices, or networks, while attackers will be tasked with infiltrating them and/or exfiltrating data from them. After a short time limit, attackers become defenders and defenders become attackers, and the duel repeats. This is not about winning or losing, it's about sparring in a digital arena to better understand the terrain and expand your capabilities in it.

> ðŸš§ TK-WORK IN PROGRESS: I'm not certain how this format should go, yet. There are many [[CTFs|InfoSec#ctfs-and-hacking-games]] that we could join, but those don't typically require us to *set up* our own infrastructure. The point of *defense* against the dark arts is to do exactly that: learn how to harden and protect our own communities, not just how to go on the offense. So, I'm of two minds. Either:
> 
> * we have somewhat longer classes for one group to set up and the other group to prepare attacks, or
> * we split into groups and *only* set up some infrastructure, then "attack" the other team's infrastructure in the time between the session and the next session

# Exercise ideas

This is a scratchpad of exercise ideas. Specific exercises/classes/sessions should get their own (sub)page.

* Sniffing open Wi-Fi:
  * Answers questions like:
    * "Why should I check for the lock icon in my browser?"
    * "How do I set up a Wi-Fi network securely?"
    * "What is the problem with WPS?"
    * "How do I get started with network sniffing?"

* â€¦?
