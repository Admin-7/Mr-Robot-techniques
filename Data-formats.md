* Base64.  This format encodes base 64 numerals by representing each digit as an ASCII character.
* * Ends in "==".  This might also be escaped as "%3D%3D".
* Hexadecimal.  This format uses the decimal digits and the first six letters of the alphabet to represent hexadecimal numerals.
* * Begins with "#".  This might also be escaped as "%23".
