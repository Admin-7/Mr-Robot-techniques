* Description: What is the operative ethic of a given feature, product design, or implementation choice you make? Who is the feature intended to empower or serve? How do we measure that? In "Ethical Refactoring," we'll take a look at small part of an existing popular feature, product, or service, analyze its UX flow/implementation/etc. from the point of view of different users, and discuss the ethical considerations and assumptions implicit in the developer's design choices. Next we'll choose a different ethic to accentuate and re-design the same feature/product/service from a different ethical perspective and see how this affects our development process and design choices.
