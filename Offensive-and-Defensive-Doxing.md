* Tagline: Practice using public information to compile a dossier on targets, and learn how to protect your personal information from trolls and worse.
* Description: Among the most common tactics in political warfare today is [doxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing), the practice of compiling and revealing sensitive, [personally identifiable information (sometimes called *PII* or *SPI*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information) to the public. This information is then used to stalk, harass, and otherwise abuse or intimidate political adversaries into silence or inaction. In this workshop, we learn how these dossiers are created by exploring common doxing techniques, both first hand and *by* hand in order to hone relevant defensive strategies. These defensive strategies cannot be totally understood or adequately applied without first understanding relevant offensive strategies. Through the experience of working collaboratively with peers to "dox" a chosen target, we then discuss defensive techniques given this expanded context and shared experience.
* Time required: ~2.5 hours
