**Network security** (or **NetSec**, or **NETSEC**), is a subdivision of information security ([[InfoSec]]) related to (potentially inter-)networked devices, as well as those device's communucations amongst one another. In practice, NetSec and InfoSec are extremely intertwined, and a clean distinction between the two is arguably unhelpful. Nevertheless, this page provides a basic starting point for cataloguing and learning about resources and initiatives related specifically to (mostly computer) networking, network security, and principles of secure communication itself.

> ðŸš§ TK-TODO: This is a work in progress. See the parent [[InfoSec]] page for a much more polished overview.

# Stuff :P

* [Deep Packet Analysis with Wireshark and Tshark, Part #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9gn0qdeWI) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IOCTeicVDg), by Candan BÃ–LÃœKBAÅž

  In this meetup we used Wireshark to decrypt HTTPS streams, reconstruct audio streams and analyze sophisticated attacks. We also used tshark to analyze pcap file and extract field to process with command line tools.

* [Home-Network Implementation Using the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X and Ubiquiti AP-AC-LR Access Point](https://www.grc.com/sn/files/Ubiquiti_Home_Network.pdf), my Mike Potts

  This guide will attempt to show users how to set up two Ubiquiti pieces of equipment, to provide for a secure 
and flexible firewall / router and a Wi-Fi Access Point. ([Source](https://github.com/mjp66/Ubiquiti))
